# Bongard problems
After conducting a web search with no apparent results for a book containing multiple [Bongard problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongard_problem) (BPs), I discovered the [OEBP page](https://www.oebp.org/) (Archive of BPs). Without any economic intention, I created this Python script to generate a PDF compiling some of the BPs. No copyright disclosures were found on the page. Please contact me for any problems regarding this subject.

The script is messy, but it doesn't matter; the point was to get it done (I recommend reading ["The Cult of Done"](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13)).

### Wikipedia Information
The idea of a Bongard problem is to present two sets of relatively simple diagrams, say A and B. All the diagrams from set A have a common factor or attribute, which is lacking in all the diagrams of set B. The problem is to find, or to formulate, convincingly, the common factor. The problems were popularised by their occurrence in the 1979 book GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter, himself a composer of Bongard problems. According to Hofstadter, "the skill of solving Bongard problems lies very close to the core of 'pure' intelligence, if there is such a thing".
